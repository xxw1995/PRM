If $3p+4q=8$ and $4p+3q=13$, what is $q$ equal to?

### Response:
Let's think step by step. To find the value of $q$, we first aim to eliminate $p$ from our equations. We do this by making the coefficient of $p$ the same in both equations. By multiplying the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3, we get two new equations: $12p + 16q = 32$ and $12p + 9q = 39$. Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first, which leads to the cancellation of $p$ and gives us $7q = -7$. Dividing both sides by 7, we find that $q = -1$. The answer is: -1.

The Smith family has 4 sons and 3 daughters. In how many ways can they be seated in a row of 7 chairs such that at least 2 boys are next to each other?

### Response:
Let's think step by step. First, realize that calculating directly is complex due to numerous cases. Instead, use complementary counting. There's only one arrangement avoiding two boys sitting together, which is BGBGBGB. For this arrangement, the boys can be seated in $4!$ ways, and the girls in $3!$ ways, totaling $4! \times 3! = 144$ undesirable seatings. To find the desired seatings, subtract these from the total unrestricted seatings of $7!$. Therefore, the number of desired seatings is $7! - (4! \times 3!) = 5040-144 = \boxed{4896}$. The answer is: 4896.

### Instruction:
A square and four circles, each with a radius of 5 inches, are arranged as shown. What is the area, in square inches, of the square? [asy]\nunitsize(1mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7pt));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(20,0)--(20,20)--(0,20)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((5,5),5));\ndraw(Circle((15,5),5));\ndraw(Circle((5,15),5));\ndraw(Circle((15,15),5));\n[/asy]

### Response:
Let's think step by step. To determine the area of the square, we need to know its side length. The diagram shows one circle in each corner of the square, with each circle touching the square's sides and adjacent circles. The diameter of one circle is twice its radius, so the diameter is $2 \times 5$ inches = $10$ inches. Since the square can accommodate two diameters along its length and width (because there are two circles along each dimension), the side length of the square is $10$ inches + $10$ inches = $20$ inches. Therefore, the area of the square is calculated by squaring its side length, which gives us $20$ inches $\times$ $20$ inches = $400$ square inches. The answer is: 400.

### Instruction:
Given that $a$ is a multiple of $1428$, find the greatest common divisor of $a^2+9a+24$ and $a+4$.

### Response:
Let's think step by step. To find the greatest common divisor of $a^2+9a+24$ and $a+4$, we apply the Euclidean Algorithm. We observe that $a^2+9a+24$ can be related to $a+4$ by subtracting $(a+5)(a+4)$ from $a^2+9a+24$, simplifying to $a^2+9a+24-(a^2+9a+20)$. This subtraction leaves us with $4$, leading to $\text{gcd}(4, a+4)$. Since $4$ is a divisor of every multiple of $1428$, including $a$ and thus $a+4$, the greatest common divisor is $4$. The answer is: 4.
