Given a list of conditions, please answer the question. Condition 1: We have the equations $3p+4q=8$ and $4p+3q=13$. Condition 2: We aim to find the value of $q$. Question: What is the value of $q$?

### Response:
Let's think step by step. To find the value of $q$, we first aim to eliminate $p$ from our equations. We do this by making the coefficient of $p$ the same in both equations. By multiplying the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3, we get two new equations: $12p + 16q = 32$ and $12p + 9q = 39$. Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first, which leads to the cancellation of $p$ and gives us $7q = -7$. Dividing both sides by 7, we find that $q = -1$. The answer is: -1.

Given a list of conditions, please answer the question. Condition 1: The Smith family consists of 4 sons and 3 daughters. Condition 2: They need to be seated in a row of 7 chairs. Condition 3: The seating arrangement should ensure that at least 2 boys sit next to each other. Question: How many such seating arrangements are possible?

### Response:
Let's think step by step. First, realize that calculating directly is complex due to numerous cases. Instead, use complementary counting. There's only one arrangement avoiding two boys sitting together, which is BGBGBGB. For this arrangement, the boys can be seated in $4!$ ways, and the girls in $3!$ ways, totaling $4! \times 3! = 144$ undesirable seatings. To find the desired seatings, subtract these from the total unrestricted seatings of $7!$. Therefore, the number of desired seatings is $7! - (4! \times 3!) = 5040-144 = \boxed{4896}$. The answer is: 4896.

Given a list of conditions, please answer the question. Condition 1: The question is depicted in the diagram: [asy]\nunitsize(1mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7pt));\ndraw((0,0)--(20,0)--(20,20)--(0,20)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((5,5),5));\ndraw(Circle((15,5),5));\ndraw(Circle((5,15),5));\ndraw(Circle((15,15),5));\n[/asy]. Condition 2: As shown in the diagram, a square is arranged with four circles each of radius 5 inches. Condition 3: Each circle is positioned at each corner inside the square. Question: What is the area of the square, in square inches?

### Response:
Let's think step by step. To determine the area of the square, we need to know its side length. The diagram shows one circle in each corner of the square, with each circle touching the square's sides and adjacent circles. The diameter of one circle is twice its radius, so the diameter is $2 \times 5$ inches = $10$ inches. Since the square can accommodate two diameters along its length and width (because there are two circles along each dimension), the side length of the square is $10$ inches + $10$ inches = $20$ inches. Therefore, the area of the square is calculated by squaring its side length, which gives us $20$ inches $\times$ $20$ inches = $400$ square inches. The answer is: 400.

Given a list of conditions, please answer the question. Condition 1: Let $a$ be a multiple of 1428. Condition 2: We are to find the greatest common divisor of the polynomial $a^2+9a+24$ and the expression $a+4$. Question: What is the greatest common divisor?

### Response:
Let's think step by step. To find the greatest common divisor of $a^2+9a+24$ and $a+4$, we apply the Euclidean Algorithm. We observe that $a^2+9a+24$ can be related to $a+4$ by subtracting $(a+5)(a+4)$ from $a^2+9a+24$, simplifying to $a^2+9a+24-(a^2+9a+20)$. This subtraction leaves us with $4$, leading to $\text{gcd}(4, a+4)$. Since $4$ is a divisor of every multiple of $1428$, including $a$ and thus $a+4$, the greatest common divisor is $4$. The answer is: 4.
